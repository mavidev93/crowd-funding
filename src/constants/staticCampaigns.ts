    "As an artist I am interested in folklore, esoteric objects and forgotten histories and I explore this primarily through drawing and printmaking. I studied Fine Art Printmaking & Photomedia at Norwich School of Art and Curating at The Royal College of Art in London. I am currently a member of Leicester Print Workshop and am based in the East Midlands.\n\nClover. A **Linocut** from Latimer's Lenormand\nNell Latimer is the pseudonym I use for various projects, and I have a website shop called Unquiet Arcadian where I sell a range of limited edition prints and card decks.\n\nThe Commonplace Tarot & Oracle decks are Kickstarter funded print projects created in 2019 and 2021. Both decks were created from linocuts drawing upon my original artwork and photographs, object based ephemera, folklore and found phenomena. Both of the decks feature original artworks that were printed at Leicester Print Workshop. I'm currently working on a card game based on medieval bestiaries and this new Lenormand deck, both using relief printmaking techniques.",

The designs are inspired by the world's first complete Star Atlas, Uranometria, composed in 1603 by astronomer Johann Bayer.  \nWhimsical and yes – a little goofy, Star Stuff-ies are sweetly expressive companions.  They are handmade by artisans, crafted from eco-friendly materials, and deeply rooted in the history of observational astronomy.\nEach Stuff-ie illustrates the exact star magnitudes and locations developed by another famous 16th Century astronomer, Tycho Brahe. If you're a real science nerd and Haptic Lab fan, you'll recognize the same embroidered star types used in our other star project and very first Kickstarter from nine years ago.",

    campaignDescription:
      'Inspired by modern and classic games, World of Anterra is a highly interactive, nonlinear, open world RPG. The game features an endlessly explorable open world, deep progression systems, fast paced combat, and rich lore, all wrapped in a satisfying and accessible interface. It’s the type of game only an independent studio could make!\n\n81monkeys has been preparing the world, narrative and game mechanics for over 3 years. This has been our passion and primary goal since founding the studio. During that time we have worked on 3 other projects, including work-for-hire, and have now been in full development of World of Anterra for over 12 months. We hope you enjoy what you see as much as we enjoy making it.\n A diverse and living world. Explore a vast world with oceans, continents, regions, castles and towns, mountains, caves and dungeons. Anterra is full of life, from little insects to hulking creatures. NPCs live out their lives following daily routines, while also responding dynamically to events in the world, as well as the player.  World of Anterra is built to be explored freely and at your own pace.\n Deep and inspiring non-linear story. The story and quests follow non-linear, divergent paths, so you can go where you want and talk to whomever you’d like. Your story will unfold naturally, based on the paths you choose to follow. \n Conversational dialogue. A unique way to converse with NPCs that allows players to have a more conversational experience with every character in the game. We ditched the overly wordy, linear dialogue experiences of modern games and designed a completely new, retro-inspired system.\n Fast and fluid party-based combat. Leveraging our vast experience across many genres of gaming, including casual and social games, combat is designed to be fun no matter how many hours you put in, with streamlined UI and engaging feedback.\n Satisfying and accessible user interface. Our design skills really shine here! We have designed an interface with the least amount of "UI" and words as possible. Instead of menus and lists, we leveraged true-to-our-world items and intuitive icons to create a wonderful user experience. Our interface is so much fun, it could be a game on its own! ',

        "campaignDescription": "My name is Tanya Kang. I am a photographer and the founder of the Pearl Jam Fan Portraits project.  This year, 2022, the book is finally becoming a reality.\n\nI wouldn’t be where I am today without Pearl Jam's music and I know that's how many Pearl Jam fans feel. 2012 is when I came up with the Fan Portraits idea. I wanted to do something to capture how much the music means to all of us, and that's what I started doing with Fan Portraits. I started taking photos of fans holding a sign with lyrics at the shows. It started small and grew into something more than I ever could have imagined. By the 2018 tour, I had captured over 1,000 fans. Now ten years since it inception, I'm finally ready to print the book and I can't do it without your support.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2018, I traveled to as many cities and states as possible on each tour to capture as many fans as I could. It was a true labor of love: taking photos all day, going to the show that night, traveling on to the next show the following day, and taking red eye flights to make it back in time to work my day job. \n\nOne of the most rewarding things to come out of working on this project is all the amazing fans that I got to meet along the way. I heard so many inspiring stories that I decided to compile the portraits and some of these stories into a collection.\n\nI've been working on the book over the last few years with some pauses along the way (having my son in 2020 is one of them!). Thanks to encouragement from several close friends I met at the shows, I was finally able to find the time to finish the book. Now I need your help to get the book printed. I'm so excited to share the portraits with you and I can't wait for you to see the collection come together in this book. Photos are meant to be printed and the images can be truly appreciated this way - it's a beautiful thing. I want the book to be more than a coffee table decoration - I want it to be something you pick up again and again.\n\n",
